# commons-sample-data

A repo to track various TOPMed and other datasets.

## TOPMed Open Access

This dataset (~100 WGS) was provided by Goncalo's team (Jonathon LeFaive), the original manifest can be found here:

    gs://topmed-irc-share/public/TOPMed.public_samples.manifest.2017.11.30.txt

I then replicated this data in AWS and GCP in public buckets to make it easier to share with collaborators for testing.

### AWS

See the [TOPMed.aws.public_samples.manifest.2017.11.30.txt](topmed_open_access/TOPMed.aws.public_samples.manifest.2017.11.30.txt)
for the locations of the cram and index files on AWS.

### GCP

See the [TOPMed.gcp.public_samples.manifest.2017.11.30.txt](topmed_open_access/TOPMed.gcp.public_samples.manifest.2017.11.30.txt)
for the locations of the cram and index files on GCP.
